# OHPI: Ontology of Host-Pathogen Interactions

OHPI is a community-driven ontology of host-pathogen interactions (OHPI) and represents the virulence factors (VFs) and how the mutants of VFs in the [Victors](http://www.phidias.us/victors/index.php) database become less virulence inside a host organism or host cells. It is developed to represent manually curated HPI knowledge available in the [PHIDIAS](http://www.phidias.us) resource .

**Example:** The OHPI object property ‘gene mutant attenuated in host cell’ represents a relation between a gene and a host cell where the microbial mutant lacking the gene is attenuated in the host cell compared to the wild type microbe. Such an object property can be used to represent a virulence factor and its interaction in a host cell, e.g., an oxidative stress response gene ahpC of *M. tuberculosis strain* H37Rv and mouse macrophage cell line J774 cell line where the ahpC mutant of strain *Mycobactrium tuberculosis* H37Rv is attenuated in J774 cells.
