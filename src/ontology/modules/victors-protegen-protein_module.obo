property_value: VO:0003558 "The type III secretion apparatus encoded on the low-calcium response (LCR) virulence plasmid, pCD1 in strain KIM5, of Y. pestis is a conserved virulence mechanism that is absolutely required for virulence of Y. pestis. YscF is a surface localized protein required both to secrete Yops and to translocate toxins into eukaryotic cells. YscF polymerization is possibly required for a YscF needle to puncture eukaryotic cell membranes. It is also likely that YscF and its homologs function to provide a base that a translocon complex is built upon, or that YscF builds a conduit from the bacterium to the eukaryotic membrane - this suggestion seems more likely given that other proteins such as YopB, YopD, and LcrV are also required for translocation into eukaryotic cells. YscF is thought to be a surface-expressed protein in Y. pestis and is required for virulence. YscF has been found to function as a protective antigen against experimental plague infection [PMID:15978133]." xsd:string

property_value: VO:0003558 "Purified preparations of HBHA were emulsified in a dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide-monophosphoryl lipid A adjuvant and tested for the ability to reduce M. tuberculosis infection in the mouse aerosol challenge model for tuberculosis. The HBHA-containing vaccine gave a approximately 0.7-log reduction in CFU in both mouse lungs and spleens compared to adjuvant controls 28 days following challenge [PMID:15557600]." xsd:string

property_value: VO:0003558 "In an attempt to generate a subunit vaccine in this experimental disease model, eukaryotic plasmid DNA expression vectors containing genes encoding either the wild-type or modified forms of recombinant listeriolysin O (hly) were generated and used for genetic vaccination of naive mice. Results of these studies indicate that the intramuscular immunization of mice with specifically designed plasmid DNA constructs encoding recombinant forms of listeriolysin O (hly) stimulates peptide-specific CD8+ immune T cells that exhibit in vitro cytotoxic activity. More importantly, such immunization can provide protective immunity against a subsequent challenge with viable L. monocytogenes [PMID:10384131]." xsd:string

property_value: VO:0003558 "Alterations to the promoter regions of bvg-activated genes can alter the kinetic pattern of expression of these genes without changing steady-state transcription levels. In addition, B. pertussis strains containing these promoter alterations that express either ptx at an early time or fha at a late time demonstrate a significant reduction in their ability to colonize respiratory tracts in an intranasal mouse model of infection [PMID:11254549]." xsd:string

property_value: VO:0003558 "Researchers examined the ability of B. pertussis mutants, defective in their ability to regulate the expression of the bvg-activated and/or the bvg-repressed genes, to cause disease in the mouse aerosol challenge model. Results indicate that the bvgR-mediated regulation of gene expression contributes to respiratory infection of mice [PMID:9712789]." xsd:string
property_value: VO:0003558 "The invasive ability of Shigella spp. is correlated with the expression of several plasmid-encoded proteins, including invasion plasmid antigen C (IpaC).  Animals asymptomatic for shigellosis after challenge with S. flexneri recognized peptide epitopes within all three epitopic regions of IpaC, whereas symptomatic animals recognized peptides in only one or two of the epitopic regions.  Antibody from monkeys challenged with S. sonnei recognized IpaC peptide epitopes which fell within and outside the three S. flexneri epitopic regions [PMID:7558301]." xsd:string
