1125	OGG_3001172676	MAb BA5 protected animals against plague, neutralized the Y. pestis type III secretion pathway and promoted opsonophagocytic clearance of bacteria in blood. LcrV residues 196-225 were necessary and sufficient for MAb BA5 binding.  These results identify LcrV residues 196-225 as a linear epitope that is recognized by the murine immune system to confer plague protection [PMID:20005318].	44	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0010874	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0000831

1122	OGG_3001172673	The type III secretion apparatus encoded on the low-calcium response (LCR) virulence plasmid, pCD1 in strain KIM5, of Y. pestis is a conserved virulence mechanism that is absolutely required for virulence of Y. pestis. YscF is a surface localized protein required both to secrete Yops and to translocate toxins into eukaryotic cells. YscF polymerization is possibly required for a YscF needle to puncture eukaryotic cell membranes. It is also likely that YscF and its homologs function to provide a base that a translocon complex is built upon, or that YscF builds a conduit from the bacterium to the eukaryotic membrane - this suggestion seems more likely given that other proteins such as YopB, YopD, and LcrV are also required for translocation into eukaryotic cells. YscF is thought to be a surface-expressed protein in Y. pestis and is required for virulence. YscF has been found to function as a protective antigen against experimental plague infection [PMID:15978133].	49	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0010878	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0000834

The protection elicited by rHCR/A1 to BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 and by rHCR/E(B) to BoNT/E(A) indicate that immunization with receptor binding domains elicit protection within sub-serotypes of BoNT [PMID:16177380].	448	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0010903	
2564	OGG_3006030102	The DNA replicon vaccine (pSCARSBHc) encoding the Hc domain of BoNT/B (BHc) induced better responses and protection against BoNT/B mouse challenge than conventional DNA vaccine.  Recombinant SFV particle VRP-BHc protected mice from high-dose BoNT/B challenge [PMID:28869522]. The production of ciBoNT/B1 HP, ciBoNT/C1 HP, ciBoNT/E1 HP and ciBoNT/F1 HP suggest the ciBoNT HP vaccines exhibit superior potency after single vaccinations.[PMID:28869522]	449	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0010904	
169	OGG_3000886209	The heterologous prime-boost strategy of live Salmonella vaccine expressing Mycobacterium tuberculosis fusion antigen Age5B-ESAT6 (esxA) from the chromosome followed by a systemic boost of antigen and adjuvant reduced the levels of M. tuberculosis bacteria in the lungs and spleen to the same extent as BCG. Additionally, this vaccination regimen was observed to be statistically equivalent in terms of protection to immunisation with BCG [PMID:16751377].    In a prophylactic vaccine model, immunization with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein ESAT-6 with LANAC adjuvant elicited significant protective immunity against aerosol challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis [PMID:16751377].	104	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0010919	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0000536

Immunization of calves with recombinant EHEC O157 EspA, intimin and Tir resulted in the generation of antibodies capable of cross-reacting with antigens from non-O157 EHEC serotypes, suggesting that immunization with these antigens may provide a degree of cross-protection against other EHEC serotypes [PMID:26020530]	199	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0010940	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0000459

39	OGG_3000876502	S. flexneri M90T is a colonisation-defective mutant with a transposon in fnr, which encodes a regulator of anaerobic metabolism. To establish whether FNR-mediated repression of spa32 and spa33 contributes to increased Shigella entry into cells in an anaerobic cabinet, recombinant M90T strains were constructed which contain spa32 and spa33 under the control of either their native promoters (M90Tp32/33) or promoters with disrupted FNR boxes (M90Tp#32/#33).The presence in M90T of spa32 and spa33 alleles that are not repressed by FNR led to IpaB secretion during anaerobic growth, and loss of the increased entry of Shigella into cells in an anaerobic cabinet [PMID:20436458].	288	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0010992	
917	OGG_3001238054	The invasive ability of Shigella spp. is correlated with the expression of several plasmid-encoded proteins, including invasion plasmid antigen C (IpaC).  Animals asymptomatic for shigellosis after challenge with S. flexneri recognized peptide epitopes within all three epitopic regions of IpaC, whereas symptomatic animals recognized peptides in only one or two of the epitopic regions.  Antibody from monkeys challenged with S. sonnei recognized IpaC peptide epitopes which fell within and outside the three S. flexneri epitopic regions [PMID:7558301].	310

Mice immunized with ZJ111/pcDNA3-SAG1 displayed significant protection against an intraperitoneally challenge with 500 tachyzoite forms of T. gondii RH strain. Vaccination at 10(7) and 10(8)CFU per mice provided a 20% and 10% survival rate comparing 100% mortality of the non-immunized mice, exhibiting longer living time and better survival rate [PMID:18590785].	326	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0011000

3950	OGG_3002664290	Researchers constructed isogenic mutants of B. pertussis Tohama expressing the alleles ptxA1 or ptxA2 and prn1 or prn2 and compared the efficacies of an acellular pertussis vaccine against the mutants in a mouse model. While the vaccine was effective against all of the B. pertussis strains regardless of the allele expression pattern, the strain expressing ptxA1 and prn2 displayed a survival advantage over the other strains [PMID:20357056].	378	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0011033	
3957	OGG_3002665068	BALB/c mice were immunized with PTx vaccine on day 6 of life and then challenged with B. pertussis using the aerosol challenge model.  These primed mice were significantly better protected against leukocytosis, weight loss, and proliferation of B. pertussis in the lungs following aerosol challenge than the nonprimed group. This protection correlated with levels of anti-PT antibody in serum present on the day of aerosol challenge [PMID:12117973].	379	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/VO_0011034	
3964	OGG_3002667056	Researchers examined the ability of B. pertussis mutants, defective in their ability to regulate the expression of the bvg-activated and/or the bvg-repressed genes, to cause disease in the mouse aerosol challenge model. Results indicate that the bvgR-mediated regulation of gene expression contributes to respiratory infection of mice [PMID:9712789].	380		
3967	OGG_3002667059	Alterations to the promoter regions of bvg-activated genes can alter the kinetic pattern of expression of these genes without changing steady-state transcription levels. In addition, B. pertussis strains containing these promoter alterations that express either ptx at an early time or fha at a late time demonstrate a significant reduction in their ability to colonize respiratory tracts in an intranasal mouse model of infection [PMID:11254549].	381

Results of these studies indicate that the intramuscular immunization of mice with specifically designed plasmid DNA constructs encoding recombinant forms of listeriolysin O (hly) stimulates peptide-specific CD8+ immune T cells that exhibit in vitro cytotoxic activity.
