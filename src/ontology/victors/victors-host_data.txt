VirB4 containing the intact NTP -binding region is essential for evasion of fusion with lysosomes (11988518).    The ruffling associated with internalization of the virB4 mutant results in a more rapid uptake than for the wild-type strain. The virB4 mutant shows primarily small regions of phalloidin staining at the sites of binding. Macrophages incubated simultaneously with B abortus and the fluid-phase marker tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-dextran accumulate the marker in large vacuoles containing the wild-type strain, but little or no marker accumulates in phagosomes containing the  virB4 mutant. Similarly, phase-contrast micrographs have shown the wild-type strain in large phase-transparent compartments, but the virB4 mutant is in much smaller compartments (14738898).    Intracellular growth-defective virB4 mutant and attenuated vaccine strain S19 did not induce abortion [PMID:15135535].     The B abortus virB4 mutant was completely cleared from the spleens of mice after 4 weeks, while the pncA  mutant showed a 1.5-log reduction of the number of bacteria isolated from spleens after 10 weeks.

The ruffling associated with internalization of the virB4 mutant results in a more rapid uptake than for the wild-type strain. The virB4 mutant shows primarily small regions of phalloidin staining at the sites of binding. Macrophages incubated simultaneously with B abortus and the fluid-phase marker tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-dextran accumulate the marker in large vacuoles containing the wild-type strain, but little or no marker accumulates in phagosomes containing the  virB4 mutant. Similarly, phase-contrast micrographs have shown the wild-type strain in large phase-transparent compartments, but the virB4 mutant is in much smaller compartments (14738898).    Intracellular growth-defective virB4 mutant and attenuated vaccine strain S19 did not induce abortion [PMID:15135535].     The B abortus virB4 mutant was completely cleared from the spleens of mice after 4 weeks, while the pncA  mutant showed a 1.5-log reduction of the number of bacteria isolated from spleens after 10 weeks.  Splenomegaly was not observed at all in mice infected with  virB4 mutant [PMID:15135535].
969	OGG_3001164505	mouse	10090					MUTATION: The Brucella abortus virB operon, encoding a type IV secretion system (T4SS), is required for intracellular replication and persistent infection in the mouse model. The products of the first two genes of the virB operon, virB1 and virB2, are predicted to be localized at the bacterial surface. Both mutants were shown to be nonpolar, as demonstrated by their ability to express the downstream gene virB5 during stationary phase of growth in vitro. Both  VirB1  and VirB2 were essential for intracellular replication in J774 macrophages. The nonpolar virB2 mutant was unable to cause persistent infection in the mouse model, demonstrating the essential role of VirB2 in the function of the T4SS apparatus during infection [PMID:16113325].    Polar mutations in the virB1 to virB2 intergenic region or in virB2 reduced the detection of VirB5 to a greater extent than they did that of VirB12. A virB1 mutation  also eliminates the transcription of virB12 in B suis [PMID:16113325].

993	OGG_3001164949	mouse	10090					MUTATION: cydB is a gene that is part of the cydAB operon encoding cytochrome bd oxidase , which catalyzes an alternate terminal electron transport step in bacterial respiration.  Transposon (Tn5) mutagenesis of B abortus cydB was severely attenuated for intracellular survival. Unlike the virulent strain 2308, the Brucella cydB::Tn5  mutant was severely compromised for survival in the spleens of inoculated mice [PMID:11274104]. The cydB and cydD mutants are also defective for the intracellular growth of B abortus and B suis, suggesting that functional cytochrome bd oxidase is required for growth in an intracellular environment [PMID:11274104].
995	OGG_3001165011	mouse	10090					MUTATION: The role of Phosphatidylcholine (PC) in Brucella abortus was examined by generating mutants in pcs (BApcs) and pmtA (BApmtA), which encode key enzymes of the two bacterial PC biosynthetic routes, the choline and methyl-transferase pathways. In rich medium, BApcs and the double mutant BApcspmtA but not BApmtA displayed reduced growth, increased phosphatidylethanolamine and no PC, showing that Pcs is essential for PC synthesis under these conditions. In minimal medium, the parental strain, BApcs and BApmtA showed reduced but significant amounts of PC suggesting that PmtA may also be functional Probing with phage Tb, antibiotics, polycations and serum demonstrated that all mutants had altered envelopes. In macrophages, BApcs and BApcspmtA showed reduced ability to evade fusion with lysosomes and establish a replication niche. In mice, BApcs showed attenuation only at early times after infection, BApmtA at later stages and BApcspmtA throughout. The results suggest that Pcs and PmtA have complementary roles in vivo related to nutrient availability and that PC and the membrane properties that depend on this typical eukaryotic phospholipid are essential for Brucella virulence [PMID:16882035].

Plasmids with Tn1725 insertions in eryC were the only ones that failed to complement the Ery phenotype of B19 [PMID:10708387].    The B. suis eryB mutant by Tn5 transposon mutagenesis was attenuated in the human macrophage -like THP-1 cells. This mutant is sensitive to erythritol and mimics the erythritol sensitive response of the B19 strain [PMID:10708387].

Allelic exchange mutants in eryC of Brucella suis were erythritol sensitive in vitro with a MIC of 1 to 5 mM of erythritol. Their multiplication in macrophage-like cells was 50 to 90- fold reduced , but complementation of the  mutant restored wild-type levels of intracellular multiplication and the capacity to use erythritol as a sole carbon source. In vivo, the eryC  mutant colonized the spleens of infected BALBc mice to a significantly lower extent than the wild type and the complemented strain. Interestingly, eryC mutants that were in addition spontaneously erythritol tolerant nevertheless exhibited wild-type-like intramacrophagic and intramurine replication. In conclusion, erythritol was not an essential carbon source for the pathogen in the macrophage host cell but that the inactivation of the eryC gene significantly reduced the intramacrophagic and intramurine fitness of B suis [PMID:10708387].

Transformation of  znuA mutant with a shuttle vector pBBR1MCS-4 containing znuA gene restored the growth in zinc chelated medium and intracellular replication in HeLa cells and macrophages to a level comparable to that of wild-type strain. Bacterial internalization into HeLa cells and macrophages and co-localization with either late endosomes or lysosomes of  znuA mutant were not different from those of wild-type strain.

The pncA mutant showed a 1.5-log reduction of the number of bacteria isolated from mouse spleens after 10 weeks [PMID:15135535]. It indicates that the mutant has reduced virulence in mice.

1112	OGG_3001167793	mouse	10090					MUTATION: The two-component BvrSBvrR system is essential for Brucella abortus virulence. Disruption of BvrSBvrR damages the outer membrane, thus contributing to the severe attenuation manifested by bvrS and  bvrR   mutants. The bvrS and  bvrR mutants are avirulent in mice, show reduced invasiveness to epithelial cells and macrophages, and are incapable of inhibiting lysosome fusion and replicating intracellularly [PMID:12218183].     Mutations in the  bvrR or bvrS genes hamper the penetration of B abortus in non-phagocytic cells and impairs intracellular trafficking and virulence. BvrRBvrS mutants do not recruit small GTPases of the Rho subfamily required for actin polymerization and penetration to cells. Dysfunction of the BvrRBvrS system alters the outer membrane permeability, the expression of several group 3 outer membrane proteins and the pattern of lipid A acylation. Constructs of virulent B abortus chimeras containing heterologous LPS from the bvrS(-) mutant demonstrated an altered permeability to cationic peptides similar to that of the BvrRBvrS  mutants. It is hypothesized that the Brucella BvrRBvrS is a system devoted to the homeostasis of the outer membrane and, therefore in the interface for cell invasion and mounting the required structures for intracellular parasitism [PMID:12218183].    In contrast to S2308 and S19, bvrS and bvrR mutant strains poorly invade HeLa cells and are rapidly targeted to cathepsin D- containing compartments [PMID:12218183].     B abortus bvrS  bvrR mutants display reduced invasiveness and virulence [PMID:12218183].    Brucella bvrS and  bvrR  null mutants are defective in several outer membrane proteins, mainly Omp3a (former Omp25) and Omp3b as well as in the structure of the LPS molecule, but the O chain seems to be intact [PMID:12218183].     Because bvrR and bvrS mutants are also altered in cell-surface hydrophobicity, permeability, and sensitivity to surface- targeted bactericidal peptides, it is proposed that BvrRBvrS controls cell envelope changes necessary to transit between extracellular and intracellular environments [PMID:12218183].     BvrR/BvrS  mutants are avirulent in mice, show reduced invasiveness in cells, and are unable to inhibit lysosome fusion and to replicate intracellularly [PMID:12218183].

1115	OGG_3001167830	mouse	10090					MUTATION: The role of Phosphatidylcholine (PC) in Brucella abortus was examined by generating mutants in pcs (BApcs) and pmtA (BApmtA), which encode key enzymes of the two bacterial PC biosynthetic routes, the choline and methyl-transferase pathways. In rich medium, BApcs and the double mutant BApcspmtA but not BApmtA displayed reduced growth, increased phosphatidylethanolamine and no PC, showing that Pcs is essential for PC synthesis under these conditions. In minimal medium, the parental strain, BApcs and BApmtA showed reduced but significant amounts of PC suggesting that PmtA may also be functional Probing with phage Tb, antibiotics, polycations and serum demonstrated that all mutants had altered envelopes. In macrophages, BApcs and BApcspmtA showed reduced ability to evade fusion with lysosomes and establish a replication niche. In mice, BApcs showed attenuation only at early times after infection, BApmtA at later stages and BApcspmtA throughout. The results suggest that Pcs and PmtA have complementary roles in vivo related to nutrient availability and that PC and the membrane properties that depend on this typical eukaryotic phospholipid are essential for Brucella virulence [PMID:16882035].

Disruption of BvrSBvrR damages the outer membrane, thus contributing to the severe attenuation manifested by bvrS and  bvrR   mutants. The bvrS and  bvrR mutants are avirulent in mice, show reduced invasiveness to epithelial cells and macrophages, and are incapable of inhibiting lysosome fusion and replicating intracellularly [PMID:11401996].     Mutations in the  bvrR or bvrS genes hamper the penetration of B abortus in non-phagocytic cells and impairs intracellular trafficking and virulence. BvrRBvrS mutants do not recruit small GTPases of the Rho subfamily required for actin polymerization and penetration to cells. Dysfunction of the BvrRBvrS system alters the outer membrane permeability, the expression of several group 3 outer membrane proteins and the pattern of lipid A acylation. Constructs of virulent B abortus chimeras containing heterologous LPS from the bvrS(-) mutant demonstrated an altered permeability to cationic peptides similar to that of the BvrRBvrS  mutants. It is hypothesized that the Brucella BvrRBvrS is a system devoted to the homeostasis of the outer membrane and, therefore in the interface for cell invasion and mounting the required structures for intracellular parasitism [PMID:11401996].

VirB4 containing the intact NTP -binding region is essential for evasion of fusion with lysosomes (11988518).    The ruffling associated with internalization of the virB4 mutant results in a more rapid uptake than for the wild-type strain. The virB4 mutant shows primarily small regions of phalloidin staining at the sites of binding. Macrophages incubated simultaneously with B abortus and the fluid-phase marker tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-dextran accumulate the marker in large vacuoles containing the wild-type strain, but little or no marker accumulates in phagosomes containing the  virB4 mutant. Similarly, phase-contrast micrographs have shown the wild-type strain in large phase-transparent compartments, but the virB4 mutant is in much smaller compartments (14738898).

The virB4 mutant shows primarily small regions of phalloidin staining at the sites of binding. Macrophages incubated simultaneously with B abortus and the fluid-phase marker tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-dextran accumulate the marker in large vacuoles containing the wild-type strain, but little or no marker accumulates in phagosomes containing the  virB4 mutant. Similarly, phase-contrast micrographs have shown the wild-type strain in large phase-transparent compartments, but the virB4 mutant is in much smaller compartments (14738898).    Intracellular growth-defective virB4 mutant and attenuated vaccine strain S19 did not induce abortion [PMID:11988518].     The B abortus virB4 mutant was completely cleared from the spleens of mice after 4 weeks, while the pncA  mutant showed a 1.5-log reduction of the number of bacteria isolated from spleens after 10 weeks.  Splenomegaly was not observed at all in mice infected with  virB4 mutant [PMID:11988518].

Smooth strains of Brucella unable to replicate (ie, killed B suis or the avirulent mutant B suis  virB5) exhibit delayed phagosome-lysosome fusion [PMID:12595417].    Polar mutations in the operon upstream of virB5 exert a greater effect on the expression of virB5  than they do on the expression of the downstream gene virB12. It indicates that in B abortus , regulatory elements other than the virB promoter may influence VirB12 protein levels [PMID:12595417].    Four independent mutants in virB5, virB9 or virB10 were highly attenuated in an in vitro infection model with human macrophages [PMID:12595417].

Possibly two types of adhesion molecules promoted uptake of Brucella, one being Ca2 and Mg2 dependent and the other not, and that both types participate in the uptake of wild-type bacteria but only the latter type participates in the uptake of the  virB9   mutant [PMID:11349069].     Four independent  mutants in virB5, virB9 or virB10 were highly attenuated in an in vitro infection model with human macrophages [PMID:11349069].    The intracellular fate of three virB  mutants (virB2, virB4 and  virB9) in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence was examined. The three VirB proteins are not necessary for penetration and the inhibition of phago-lysosomal fusion within non-professional phagocytes. Rather, the virB mutants  are unable to reach the replicative niche and reside in a membrane -bound vacuole expressing the late endosomal marker, LAMP1, and the sec61beta protein from the ER membrane, proteins that are present in autophagic vesicles originating from the ER [PMID:11349069].    Attenuated non-polar virB2, virB4, virB8, virB9 and virB10 Brucella  mutants are capable of penetrating cells as the same rate as the virulent wild-type Brucella, transit through EEA1 -positive early compartments and then localize in LAMP1-positive compartments at early times of infection [PMID:11349069].

A B. abortus virB10 mutant showed a decrease of intracellular live bacteria comparable to that of the wild-type strain until 4 h after infection, indicating that a functional VirB system is not required for the short-term survival of Brucella inside macrophages. At later time points, the number of live virB10 mutants  progressively decreased. Hence, the Brucella  virB10  strain did not replicate, but rather was killed. Although the  virB10 mutants are capable of short-term survival, they can not evade long-term degradation through fusion with lysosomes [PMID:11401996].  B abortus virB1 and virB10 mutants are unable to persist in mouse spleens after i.p. inoculation, suggest that attenuation in the animal model is due to an inability of these strains to grow intracellularly [PMID:11401996].

In HeLa cells and bovine macrophages, no attenuation of the ftcR mutant was observed compared to the WT parental strain. In BALB/c mice, the ftcR mutant was not attenuated after 1 week of infection but was attenuated after 4 weeks of infection.

High-affinity zinc uptake system protein mutant (znuA  mutant) showed reduced growth in zinc chelated medium, and failed to replicate in HeLa cells and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages.  Transformation of  znuA mutant with a shuttle vector pBBR1MCS-4 containing znuA gene restored the growth in zinc chelated medium and intracellular replication in HeLa cells and macrophages to a level comparable to that of wild-type strain. Bacterial internalization into HeLa cells and macrophages and co-localization with either late endosomes or lysosomes of  znuA mutant were not different from those of wild-type strain.

The defect in B19 was complemented in trans by plasmids containing the complete ery region and by plasmids with Tn1725 insertions in  eryA, eryB and eryD. Plasmids with Tn1725 insertions in eryC were the only ones that failed to complement the Ery phenotype of B19 [PMID:16177356].     Allelic exchange mutants in eryC of Brucella suis were erythritol sensitive in vitro with a MIC of 1 to 5 mM of erythritol. Their multiplication in macrophage-like cells was 50 to 90- fold reduced , but complementation of the  mutant restored wild-type levels of intracellular multiplication and the capacity to use erythritol as a sole carbon source. In vivo, the eryC  mutant colonized the spleens of infected BALBc mice to a significantly lower extent than the wild type and the complemented strain. Interestingly, eryC mutants that were in addition spontaneously erythritol tolerant nevertheless exhibited wild-type-like intramacrophagic and intramurine replication. In conclusion, erythritol was not an essential carbon source for the pathogen in the macrophage host cell but that the inactivation of the eryC gene significantly reduced the intramacrophagic and intramurine fitness of B suis [PMID:16177356].

High-affinity zinc uptake system protein mutant (znuA  mutant) showed reduced growth in zinc chelated medium, and failed to replicate in HeLa cells and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages.  Transformation of  znuA mutant with a shuttle vector pBBR1MCS-4 containing znuA gene restored the growth in zinc chelated medium and intracellular replication in HeLa cells and macrophages to a level comparable to that of wild-type strain. Bacterial internalization into HeLa cells and macrophages and co-localization with either late endosomes or lysosomes of  znuA mutant were not different from those of wild-type strain. These results suggest that znuA does not contribute to intracellular trafficking of B abortus, but contributes to utilization of zinc required for intracellular growth [PMID:12761078].

The products of the first two genes of the virB operon, virB1 and virB2, are predicted to be localized at the bacterial surface. Both mutants were shown to be nonpolar, as demonstrated by their ability to express the downstream gene virB5 during stationary phase of growth in vitro. Both  VirB1  and VirB2 were essential for intracellular replication in J774 macrophages. The nonpolar virB2 mutant was unable to cause persistent infection in the mouse model, demonstrating the essential role of VirB2 in the function of the T4SS apparatus during infection [PMID:15322008].    Polar mutations in the virB1 to virB2 intergenic region or in virB2 reduced the detection of VirB5 to a greater extent than they did that of VirB12.

Transposon (Tn5) mutagenesis of B abortus cydB was severely attenuated for intracellular survival. Unlike the virulent strain 2308, the Brucella cydB::Tn5  mutant was severely compromised for survival in the spleens of inoculated mice [PMID:11274104]. The cydB and cydD mutants are also defective for the intracellular growth of B abortus and B suis, suggesting that functional cytochrome bd oxidase is required for growth in an intracellular environment [PMID:11274104].

2877	OGG_3002943079	mouse	10090					MUTATION: Two Hantaan virus strains, clone 1 (cl-1), which is virulent in newborn mice, and its attenuated mutant (mu11E10), were used to examine the pathogenesis of Hantaan virus infection in a mouse model and identify virus factors relating to virulence. After subcutaneous inoculation of newborn BALB/c mice, cl-1 caused fatal disease with high viral multiplication in peripheral organs, but mu11E10 produced nonfatal infection with a low level of virus multiplication. Sequence comparison detected a single deduced amino acid change (cl-1 Ile to mu11E10 Thr) at amino acid number 515 in glycoprotein G1. In mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro, viruses possessing a cl-1-derived M segment grew more rapidly than viruses containing a mu11E10-derived M segment. These results suggest that the single amino acid change in the glycoprotein alters peripheral growth, which affects invasion of the central nervous system in mice [PMID:10982372].
